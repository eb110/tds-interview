# assumption decissions

- the rtq redux functionality has been utilised for API required requests
- the MaterialUI components has been utilised for application UI
- the react-router routing has been applied as a routing solution
- the roboto fonts are the main fonts of the project
- ts is the only programming language utilised for the project
